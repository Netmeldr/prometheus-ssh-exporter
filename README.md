# prometheus-ssh-exporter
A Prometheus exporter for monitoring SSH connections

This is a personal project I wrote because I couldn't find any prometheus exporters that I could monitor my SSH connections with.

Note: The docker file is only for development. This program is not meant to be used in a docker container.
